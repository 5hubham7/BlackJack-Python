The player goes first and must decide whether to STAND or HIT. Thus, a player may STAND on the two cards originally dealt to them, OR they may ask the dealer for additional cards, one at a time, until deciding to STAND on the total (if it is 21 or under), OR goes BUST. Player can count the ace as a 1 or 11, If the draw creates a BUST hand by counting the ace as an 11, then player simply counts the ace as a 1 and continues playing by STANDING or HITTING."
